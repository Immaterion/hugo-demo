[{"content":"Author\u0026rsquo;s Note A/N: As I kept watching the show, more ideas kept springing up in my mind about the potential of what kind of story I wanted to make about these men. In my head canon Einar is working hard for a future with Thorfinn in it. He practically chases after him like a male wife in the show. I need my catharsis, so maybe chapters that lead to something unspeakably hot might be on the table and I am leading with Thorfinn is a masochist who needs his demons exorcised by Einar’s fat cock. lol Enjoy.\n“Can you believe it? Look how much we’ve achieved in three years!” Einar exclaimed as he spread his arms, the forest cleared on their side of the river Ketil had loaned them. Thorfinn sighed as he dropped his axe, his hands on his knees. The shorter man reached for his tunic on the ground cast aside to wipe the sweat from his face.\n“It is amazing, Einar. You’re right.” Thorfinn said slowly as he wiped his brow again as he tried to catch his breath. It was sweltering hot out this summer, but Einar hadn’t felt more alive. They were that much closer to freedom. He could taste it.\nEinar sat on a nearby stump as he reached for a ladle in the bucket of water beside him. Einar took a big sip, sighing aloud. As he reached for another scoop, Thorfinn came into his view to snatch the ladle away from Einar, watching with mouth agape as he greedily drank its contents. The shorter blond had a way of staring into his soul that made Einar’s heart thump, and he hated it. He hated how scatter-brained he became whenever Thorfinn was near him.\nEinar found himself asking odd questions. What did he find so desirable about a man? When Einar really thought about it, there was nothing in particular about Thorfinn that he could say that was strikingly attractive. So, what was it?\nEinar stared at the top of Thorfinn’s head as they trudged through the fields that led to the former Master’s home. It was customary to check on him due to his declining health. Both he and Thorfinn, and the slave maid Hild were tasked by Hebi to keep a close eye on the stubborn old goat ever since he was found collapsed in one of the fields.\n“Hey, Thorfinn…” Einar muttered as they made their way to the house. Thorfinn looked back at the taller man, attentive to his every word as they stopped.\n“What’s wrong, Einar?” Thorfinn stepped in closer, the wind picking up all of a sudden. The trees rustled in a way that seemed to slow time down around them. Thorfinn wiped at loose, blond locks spilling across his forehead and eyes, looking up at the older man. It hit Einar then. There was nothing more ethereal, more fragile but stronger in existence, nothing that could compare to the complexity of whatever Thorfinn, son of Thor, was. If beauty was in the words a person said or the kindness in their eyes, the scars that litter body and soul… then Thorfinn was the most beautiful thing he’d ever laid his eyes on.\nEinar found himself unable to speak, which was strange of him when he was always the one to start conversations and chat up a storm, even at his most nervous. He could be in the dark about how he was feeling now and forever, or he could find out what this was happening between them. Einar wasn’t one for mincing words or wasting time.\n“What we did…” Einar began, remembered vividly sharing a kiss, focusing on the details of their lips touching. Einar had been surprised at the softness of them, or how Thorfinn gave into his advances and melted in his arms. Nothing happened beyond that, and at the time Einar thought they had both lost their minds.\nIt didn’t stop the feeling of how right it felt to do. Thorfinn hadn’t mentioned it since, and for a while it bothered Einar if that was ok to do.\n“The nightmares?” Thorfinn tilted his head, clueless.\n“No, not that!” Einar sucked his teeth, throwing his hands up in the air as his cheeks colored. Why was this so difficult to convey? “The kissing. You know.” He made some sort of gesture with his hands that only sent Thorfinn’s eyes following his hands without much thought. Einar felt like he was losing the moment to convey things clearly by the second.\n“Oh.” They both stared at each other, the sounds of crows cawing loudly in the background.\n“This is the part where you say something?” Einar rubbed his forehead, and Thorfinn brought the axe down from his shoulder. “Are you asking me this because you feel uncomfortable?”\nEinar stiffened a bit. He hadn’t counted on Thorfinn being this direct, either. It was silly to make a stink of things when he clearly initiated the kiss in a lapse of judgment. Thorfinn needed something and in the moment, Einar had given them both something to feel alive.\n“I wondered if it was the wrong thing to do… you were in distress and I took advantage of that.” Einar kicked a rock off the pebbled path into lush grass. “I wasn’t honorable at all, Thorfinn—” He turned to look at Thorfinn’s widened stare, his cheeks red. Einar had never seen him this way, wondering if he’d truly offended him.\n“You worried this much over a kiss? Einar…” Thorfinn reached up to grab the redhead’s neck to bring him down to his level, kissing him. “If you were curious to kiss me, alk you had to do was ask.” Thorfinn whispered in what Einar suspected was a teasing tone coming from the shorter man. It seemed there were many facets about this man Einar he had yet to know. He’d never known Thorfinn to be a humorous man, but it suddenly made him feel at ease.\nEinar trailed after the retired warrior like a puppy unable to hide his eagerness, babbling on about their plans to leave this place and the things they would achieve, knowing at any moment the stars would fall should the gods find fault in them, their luck ending with them. Every day they were reminded of their status as slaves, but it never broke their minds. For that, Einar was thankful.\nHowever, one fateful day this would all come to a halt. Einar had felt it in the pit of his stomach for a while as jealous eyes watched them toil the fields year after year. The proof of his suspicions were confirmed upon eyeing the destruction of their prominent wheat fields one day as Einar and Thorfinn looked out at their wheat fields, completely destroyed. It took them so much time to toil the toughest areas of the land to plant seeds, and they were just out of time to make it to harvest.\nEinar was furious, dare he say far more than the day he foolishly attempted to harm Thorfinn all those years ago. Thorfinn could see Einar unraveling, reaching for Einar’s shoulder to speak some sense into him.\n“Einar please, if you do anything they will only make life harder for you.”\n“I don’t give a damn what these people think!” Einar shook off Thorfinn’s hand from his shoulder with a rage he could barely contain. He felt murderous and knew who the culprits were. He could bet the crown on it.\n“You truly are a good man, Thorfinn.” Einar said darkly, clouds rolling in as it darkened the sky. “They won’t get away with this.”\nEinar sped down the path in hopes of running across the group of stable hands that seemed to shadow their every move. Today, however, they were nowhere to be seen which raised Einar’s suspicion. He would not hear Thorfinn’s breathless pleas to stop this madness trailing behind him, and Einar was sick of his pacifist nonsense today. In Thorfinn’s mind the way of the world would never change, but Einar thought differently. In his mind he was still as free as the rolling hills of England he was born in, and no man would break his spirit.\nEinar was no one’s chattel, not in this life or the next.\nWith luck his eyes landed on the posse of stable hands making their way up the hill, carrying on and laughing about something. Einar was sure what about. “YOU!” Einar bellowed across the field; his hands balled in a fist as he ignored Thorfinn’s final warning.\n“It was you lot who ruined our wheat fields, wasn’t it!”\nThe shorter stout one began to laugh. As usual, their cruelty was palpable and unforgiving as ever, and devoid of empathy. Einar would pity them if he didn’t hate them so much. Einar found himself visibly disgusted by their desperate need to cling to their superiority complex. Today, though, he would have his reckoning. Master Ketil be damned.\nEinar’s plan unfortunately did not go according to plan, and it ended in both Einar and Thorfinn being jumped while defending themselves. There was nothing fair about the fight, and hours after the ordeal he would be forced to hear Hild scolding him for the tenth time about what it means to be a slave.\nEinar was sick of hearing it. The world, as he was coming to terms with finding out, terrified him. There seemed to be no end to this darkness. All Einar wanted to do was lash out. He so desperately wanted out, and nothing was going his way. Was it time to accept his fate? Was this how his life would be forever?\nWhen Einar found himself back at the barn after nursing sore ribs, he found Thorfinn fast asleep. He was bruised badly, but in the end, he always slept like a baby. He wondered if he would be visited by his ghosts tonight and sat up in his corner of the shed with a soft groan. He would get no sleep either way, so he opted to look at the stars and wondered what realities spanned beyond them.\nIt wasn’t long until he heard Thorfinn’s body squirming in the hay, watching on as the man fought dark principalities that seemed to hold him hostage every night. Like clockwork, Einar stood up and sat by the younger man’s side. It was a delicate thing not to wake him, as it had mixed results if Thorfinn was woken up. Einar carefully grabbed Thorfinn’s arms to lock them on both sides of his chest, spooning into him from behind.\n“I’m here,” He whispered softly. Thorfinn wailed and kicked, but Einar was as strong as a pillar, unyielding as he easily held the young man in his arms until Thorfinn went limp, exhausted. He sobbed when he lost consciousness, turning to bury his face into Einar’s hairy chest. The pain radiating down his ribs was nothing compared to Thorfinn’s pain, he was sure.\nHe whispered things into Thorfinn’s ear that only he could hear, the words calming him as Thorfinn held on tight. “The demons will not get you tonight.” Einar would say in comfort, and it always seemed to do the trick but tonight Thorfinn seemed to need more.\n“Einar, please…” Thorfinn whispered into the intimate space between their faces, that needy tone activating something that pooled deep into his belly and cock as Thorfinn kissed him. It started out slow, tongues seeking, their bodies pressed together as they shared a hot kiss in the hay. Einar found himself rolling on top of Thorfinn, cradled between his thighs.\n“Einar…” Thorfinn whimpered as Einar’s large hands found Thorfinn’s wrists, forcing them above his head. Thorfinn winced in pain, and Einar paused in fear that he would hurt him. He had done so many stupid things that risked their lives as of late.\n“It’s ok, keep going…” The blond arched invitingly into the older man, their groins meeting. He could feel Thorfinn’s cock rising in sexual interest, and at that moment Einar knew he would always want more of this. Thorfinn brought something illicit out of him, weathered hands tracing scars that littered Thorfinn’s wrists and arms, mapping out each imperfect flaw on his skin.\n“Have you ever laid with a man?” Thorfinn huffed as Einar began yanking off his own trousers, his cock bouncing as he kicked them away from him as if offended by the article of clothing. Thorfinn eyed Einar’s cock with an intensity he’d never seen before, suddenly feeling self-conscious about it.\n“No. You?”\n“Yes.” Thorfinn said slowly, swallowing. “Sometimes when soldiers were in the mood, they…” Thorfinn stopped his sentence, swallowing again. Einar shook his head, lying Thorfinn back. “You don’t have to explain…” Einar leaned down to kiss him again, sliding Thorfinn’s trousers off. The young man gasped as ankles met the air, Einar spreading his legs to take a good look at his prize.\nEinar studied every scar and committed them to memory, noting the way Thorfinn’s toned stomached tightened, the dip of his hip bones, soft golden hair that nestled his already leaky cock and full balls. It did strange things to Einar to see another man’s cock up in excitement to his touch, those moans bringing his cock to life in an instant.\nEinar instinctively did what he naturally would do, spreading Thorfinn’s knees back as he inspected that cock, watching it twitch in anticipation. He could hear Thorfinn’s voice catch as he curiously licked and sucked the tip of his foreskin. He liked the taste of him, Einar discovered.\nThe desperately horny look in Thorfinn’s eyes made Einar want to mount him like an animal and pound him down to dust, but Einar knew better. He would not be like any of the men who took advantage of Thorfinn.\nHe would take him as a lover would.\nThorfinn’s knees buckled as Einar’s bearded mouth swirled circles against Thorfinn’s perineum before he was mouth to ass. Thorfinn tucked his knees back in pleasure, a whimper of unabated lust escaping the blond as Einar’s wandering hand found a nipple to twist and tease; the sounds of Thorfinn’s pleasure music to his ears.\nThorfinn bucked forward as Einar’s tongue began to slip inside soft, puckered flesh, lifting those hips to push those knees back as he sucked him shamelessly from taint to tailbone. Thorfinn babbled something unrecognizable in another language as he shuddered violently before coming thick ropes across his chest and chin.\nEinar spit into his hand to coat his cock before reaching over Thorfinn. “Keep going?” He huffed softly, his aching sex rubbing into Thorfinn’s belly.\nThorfinn turned on his stomach, putting his face in the hay. “I need it, please use me…” Einar could barely think as Thorfinn lifted his ass in position to be mounted, and Einar felt mesmerized by that wet pink hole. Einar pressed a thumb in gently, watching as Thorfinn reacted with an arch and gasp as it slipped deep inside his ass. Einar rubbed him there, finally spreading him with one hand, guiding his girthy cock against that hole.\nThorfinn hissed as Einar made his descent into that tight warmth, burying his head into the hay beneath him as he grasped Thorfinn’s hips, a hand pressing into the small of his back to hold him still. Einar took his time to get Thorfinn open, wet and loose as he slowly broke the shorter male in until he was to the brim. It felt so good, Einar thought, his eyes rolling into the back of his head as he felt Thorfinn’s ass clench around him, further trapping him inside.\nEinar’s hips moved, the slow heavy slap of his balls meeting ass permeating the air as he fucked Thorfinn deep and hard. The blond whimpered as Einar pounded him without reprieve, the heat of his walls sending him to heights he’d never felt.\nJust then Einar felt Thorfinn’s hands on his own to guide to his neck, and for a moment he was unsure of what it was Thorfinn wanted him to do.\n“To cum…” He gasped as Einar began to squeeze his neck testily, his cock already impossibly hard at the act. He was already balls-deep in the man, finding the act both twisted and erotic. There was no telling what twisted little things Thorfinn enjoyed during sex, but for now Einar was more than happy to indulge his little masochist.\nWith every press into his jugular, he could feel Thorfinn’s hot walls tighten around his cock, Thorfinn’s own cock slick wet with precum as it dribbled down his thighs.\n“I’m so close,” Einar said roughly as Thorfinn beat him to the punch, seizing up beneath the older man without warning. Einar could feel the spasms overwhelm his cock mid-thrust, burying as deep as he could with what few hard thrusts he could manage before emptying his balls into Thorfinn before collapsing on top of him.\n“Fuck! That was…” Einar gasped, burying his face into Thorfinn’s messy hair.\n“Yeah…” Thorfinn muffled from the hay bed beneath Einar, unable to move.\nEinar slipped out of Thorfinn with a pop, admiring his messy handiwork with a grin before slapping Thorfinn’s ass and toppling next to him. There had been a first for many things, but Einar was sure he would never tire of this, if Thorfinn wanted it as well.\nThey had lost something valuable today in the wheat fields, but Einar felt he had gained something far more valuable with Thorfinn by his side. He always could count on Thorfinn to help him clear his head and stay focused. With Thorfinn snuggling into his side, Einar wrapped his arm around his shoulders, staring up at the ceiling. They could always start anew and rebuild what they lost if they had each other.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/feed/qs/qs2/","summary":"Author\u0026rsquo;s Note A/N: As I kept watching the show, more ideas kept springing up in my mind about the potential of what kind of story I wanted to make about these men.

He lifted the axe and began to chop as Einar stared into his weathered hands. With every chop they were both reminded that their time on this farm would be up someday. Soon, they would be free of this nightmare.\nDeep down Einar did not feel he would ever be free of the feeling roiling inside of him. He would never be free of the horrors of loss and of war and what it did to him and his family, and there were many others just like him for as far as his heavy feet could carry him. His entire life was upended by greed and corruption of tyrants just to be sold into slavery. If he could turn back time, Einar would have done things differently.\nA part of him knew the reality of things. Slavery was rampant, and there was always news of slave traders making their rounds in lands unheard of. There was no escape from death and war. Einar was far away from home, and even if he wanted to go back there would be nothing to go back to.\nEinar had very little remorse for warriors, Jomsviking or not. All they did was rape, pillage and steal the lives of others. There was nothing honorable about men who killed on command. He was so convinced they were all murdering dogs without a conscience, and for a time Einar was comfortable believing in that.\n“Do you hate me, Einar? I murdered so many people, I cannot even count. I don’t think I remember.” Eyes souless, Thorfinn let Einar in for the first time since he’d met the man, the trees rustling softly as they always do as Thorfinn continued.\n“You say there are things in this world that are worth living for? For me there is nothing, Einar. From the moment I could hold a sword, I have had nothing to look forward to but my own death.”\nShock rolled down Einar’s spine as Thorfinn revealed his past to him in the woods. Had he been such a fool for trusting a man like Thorfinn? Struggling to quell his disgust, Einar seethed at those words that day. He remembered them over and over as an unfamiliar darkness took root in his heart that would drive him to do the worst thing when the sun set.\nEinar felt the pain of loss driving him as he stood up in the barn to stand over Thorfinn’s still body. He could not fathom how someone who did all those things could sleep so damn peacefully. It enraged him deeply, barely able to contain his rage as he bent a knee, his giant frame shadowing Thorfinn’s small body in comparison.\nEinar reached for Thorfinn’s neck. He remembered the sounds of her voice dwindling away as she was hacked to death. A strange light was in Einar’s eyes as his hands reached down to touch Thorfinn’s neck before gripping it with both hands.\nIt was strange how Thorfinn wasn’t moving, how lost in sleep he was. Einar could easily kill him, and nobody would be none the wiser. Einar tightened his grip, the sound of Thorfinn’s soft gasps in his sleep reaching his ears, only further sending him into a rage.\nAll Einar could think about were his sister’s shrieks, fully entrenched in the horrors that night as Thorfinn began to choke and splutter under his iron grip.\nJust then, what Einar had never counted on was hearing Thorfinn’s screams. He was screaming and wailing in a way that sent Einar up and off the man, startled. Thorfinn kicked and screamed as if something invisible was holding him, weighing him down as if he was possessed. Einar turned away from him, shame finally burrowing into him at this discovery.\nThere was no hell deep or vast enough for men like Thorfinn. His mind was already broken by the ravages of war, and his sins would catch up to him eventually, if not already. In an instant he realized nothing would be solved if he killed him now. What would he stand to gain taking a man’s life at his most pitiable moment?\nShame radiated in Einar\u0026rsquo;s chest to the pit of his stomach as he heard Thorfinn cry for relief he would never get, hands in the air like an infant seeking his mother as soon as he was conscious. And just like that, the moment had passed.\nEinar had never seen the battlefield for himself or what it truly did to men’s minds, but now he had an idea. He hated the idea of pitying a murderer. As Thorfinn grabbed Einar’s tunic, trembling in his own cold sweat and tears, he reached for Thorfinn instinctively. With a softer tone in his voice, he whispered “I’m here\u0026hellip;”\nIt was the strangest thing watching Thorfinn relax after such a mentally draining ordeal, weary eyed, shamelessly holding his hand for comfort, the marks on his neck still fresh. Einar felt the shame of his actions truly hit him like a weight then. He decided he would never do something like this ever again. He would be a better man.\nThey never spoke about what happened in the barn. Einar still wasn’t sure if Thorfinn knew what he had done, or the dream was so terrible he couldn’t tell what happened. Einar would not look at him for days after, the guilt hitting him in waves when Thorfinn smiled trustingly up at him, or divulged more things from his past when he was comfortable to share. Thorfinn wasn’t a very talkative man, so it elated Einar at times when he would dump information about himself out of the blue.\nThorfinn was unaware of social cues, and was a very awkward man when it came to speaking to others. He was the most uncomfortable when people were animated, finding the shorter blond overwhelmed by Helga’s tears when complaining about Master Ketil.\nEinar had come to know more about Thorfinn in the months they worked together plowing the wheat fields. At night, the nightmare episodes did not end for Thorfinn, and Einar found himself unreluctantly becoming a support system despite his conflicted feelings about Thorfinn’s bloody past.\nOver time he came to understand that this was more than a sickness, Einar thought. It was like something terrible was happening only in Thorfinn’s mind, and for once Einar found himself empathizing with Thorfinn over the years as he heard more about the battles he fought.\nThere was nothing impressionable about murdering others for material gains, or status. But, Thorfinn had not mentioned anything about spoils of war. He only spoke of his days being forced as a child to kill as men worse than him set a horrible example. Einar slowly found that Thorfinn’s lust for revenge sent him on a dangerous path in the same way Einar contemplated revenge on him.\nIt was almost poetic. He was sure whatever gods existed were laughing at him.\nEvery night Thorfinn screamed, and every night Einar was there. It was a normal occurrence for Einar to be looking over Thorfinn’s shaking body, toil-weathered hands brushing the sweat from Thorfinn’s sweaty forehead. When had he come to care for someone like this? It puzzled Einar that he treated this man far better than any cattle or possession he’d ever owned.\n“I’m here,” Einar said slowly as Thorfinn looked around frantically, his hands fisted in Einar’s tunic.\n“I-I’m sorry, I\u0026ndash;” Thorfinn made a panicked, muffled sob. “It never ends, it\u0026ndash;” Einar decided to do something different, reaching to hold him in a way he was sure he would have done with his own son had he been born in this world. A long finger explored blond tresses as Einar rocked Thorfinn back and forth. It seemed to soothe the blond, watching the man go limp with a yawn, suddenly sleepy.\nEinar blinked. He had never seen Thorfinn so relaxed, much less yawning. Einar snorted. The idea that Thorfinn could ever harm anyone dispelled in his mind. The man he was holding now could not possibly harm a flea.\nThorfinn looked up at him, a new light in his eyes. “Thank you, Einar.”\nHe wasn’t sure what Thorfinn was thanking him for. For the first time Einar\u0026rsquo;s cheeks went ruddy with color, so he opted for staring at the moon. “I can’t get any sleep with you making all that noise every night. Somebody’s got to look out for you. You’re practically vulnerable in that state!” He pouted, doing his best to ignore Thorfinn’s curious stare.\nWhatever place he was in years ago seemed like a distant memory. And just as he was going to forget it all-together, Thorfinn touched Einar’s cheek, sending the man’s thoughts crashing as he stared at Thorfinn. His heart raced as Thorfinn stared at him, contact unwavering as he traced a finger over Einar’s beard\u0026hellip; his lips\u0026hellip;\nThat strange look was in his eyes again, Thorfinn’s hand finding Einar’s as he brought it to his neck. Einar touched along his jugular vein, felt the racing pulse there. The moonlight washed over pale skin and blond hair that seemed to spill everywhere in the hay beneath them.\n“I know.” Thorfinn whispered as Einar began to pull his hand back. “You did what you had to. I did terrible things\u0026hellip;” The sad look in those eyes caused Einar’s heart to seize. He wanted to run and abandon this cursed place with Thorfinn now more than ever and find a place away from all the madness. He knew Ketil would have other plans.\nEinar reached down to kiss him and was more than surprised when Thorfinn kissed back, matching him in ferocity. It was no surprise how lonely they’d both been, and Einar hadn’t touched a woman in ages. In that moment things felt easy to do and nothing seemed off limits. Einar had never kissed a man before, but he also had never been a slave. He never thought he would be utterly changed by someone like Thorfinn or vice versa.\nThere in the darkness of the hay stables, they shared a kiss so innocent under the waning moon, the stars being their only audience.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/feed/qs/qs1/","summary":"Author\u0026rsquo;s Note I hope you can enjoy my self-indulgent fic. :)\n. . .\n“\u0026hellip;nar\u0026hellip;Einar?”\nEinar stared back into Thorfinn’s concerned face, having forgotten what they were talking about.\nThorfinn huffed and stood in his usual quiet way, wondering off to grab the axe from the nearest tree beside them.

Agnus peered back at Credo with contempt, his ridiculous monocle glinting as he did so.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, Credo. I was just leaving.\u0026rdquo; Agnus decided to say a little too loudly. \u0026ldquo;Your excellency.\u0026rdquo; He bowed dramatically as he exited the room.\nDespite several attempts to take his place, Credo was almost certain Sanctus would never sway for the likes of Agnus. Agnus was an insipid, obnoxious brute who fancied himself a scholar. He was as bland as his poor taste in clothing. He was all but annoying, overbearingly analytical at times. Credo was sure Agnus was dropped on the head as a child. Simply put, Credo hated the man. He particularly hated that nasty glint in Agnus\u0026rsquo; eye whenever he came around. It was clear he wanted his position. Had Agnus known what it took to be here at Sanctus\u0026rsquo; side, had he known of the sacrifices Credo had given to be here\u0026hellip; he was sure Agnus would never have the bravery to stand in his shoes.\nWithout question he took his seat by Sanctus, the figure head that the Order of Sparta revered. Their chapter had started here in Fortuna City, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until recently their campaign had expanded beyond Credo\u0026rsquo;s wildest dreams. Some had speculated about Sanctus and his motives. Credo had no time for speculation, especially with the demon gates popping up on the outskirts of the city. Like a loyal, trained dog, he did as he was told. He questioned nothing all these years until recently.\nCredo had felt it for a while now that something was afoot. He didn\u0026rsquo;t understand how he knew, but he did. The things he\u0026rsquo;d seen\u0026hellip; Sanctus was plotting something, and he\u0026rsquo;d been suspicious for a time. The commander knew that someday that fervent loyalty would be put to the test. Sanctus\u0026rsquo; long gaze brought Credo at attention, stiffening at the look in that old fox\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Credo sat at the old man’s side, crossing his kid-skin gloved hands one over the other against the table.\n“Credo,” He was firm, but age had settled into his voice. Credo listened intently just for that reason.\n“Your boy, Nero, is it? I hear complaints…” It always took Sanctus a while to get to the point. It took everything in Credo’s body not to twitch. He’d heard of Nero’s raucous nearly enough already. And now his foolish sister was batting lashes at him. Credo was definitely not in the mood to hear even his Holiness.\n\u0026lsquo;You’d think he’d give a damn and show some respect to the other members. Now, I’m up to my neck in complaints. When I catch that brat…’ Credo thought angrily. He didn’t bat a lash as Sanctus’ rested his hand over Credo’s tightly clutched ones. No matter how many times Sanctus did this, Credo could never feel the warmth of them.\n“I will take any measure to get him in line. I just need more time, your Holiness. He\u0026rsquo;s still a boy—“\n“Yes, I realize that.” Sanctus interjected calmly. Credo held his tongue.\n“He is your charge. His lack of discipline is a direct image of you. He has no respect for the sanctity of Sparda.\u0026quot; Sanctus began.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, Credo,” Sanctus whispered sweetly, the pad of his thumb brushing Credo’s gloved hand. The action made his skin crawl, but he watched Sanctus carefully. He swallowed down his resentment, finally speaking up.\n“Yes, your Holiness?”\n“You know what happens to those who cannot behave well with the Order?” Credo stared into his lap for a long time before he snapped his head up attentively.\n“Yes your Holiness, I do.”\nWhen Credo had finally entered his home it had been late. Credo rested his head at the door, feeling the heavy weight of the information Sanctus shared in private with him.\nAll this talk of a Savior from Sanctus was all he was thinking about. Sanctus had promised many things during this secret meeting, but Credo began to wonder if it was all the fantasy of a senile old man. Nevertheless, Credo was fascinated. Was it possible to become an angel?\nHe trudged up the steps slowly as he tugged open his uniform. A bottle of brandy and schematics of Blanco Angelo, a special guardian class that would be constructed to protect the city were littered about the messy floor of his study. It was his space of Zen, a place he could go to when things were out of control. Right now he wanted to tug off his strapped boots, and fall asleep on the divan in that room. Tonight\u0026rsquo;s choice of poison would be Cognac Brandy, a twenty-year old Delamain Pale \u0026amp; Dry that was given to him as a gift when he ascended the ranks to Commander.\nHis household was a respectively quiet place. Kyrie was hardly ever here now, constantly at the church to pray and sing and do whatever young girls her age did. Despite his beloved sister’s absence, Credo enjoyed the peace and quiet when he could. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t one for social interactions, and enjoyed being alone. Deep into his thirties, Credo had learned to befriend his loneliness. The job had no room for much of anything else. The rest was simply chaos.\nEntering his study (which was adjacent to the master bedroom) Credo tossed his uniform top across the divan, settling in an old wooden chair with a sigh. There were simple pleasures in life, and this chair was certainly one of them. The crystal snifter of brandy sat untouched at the messy desk beside him as he contemplated drinking to boost his denial at what was going on. It was always a choice he had no problem making.\nUntil now.\nCredo was always known to be self-sufficient. Since the time his parents passed away, he’d stepped up to take care of his little sister, Kyrie. Things had been very hard at first—he was only fifteen years old when Sanctus took power of the Order.\nCredo’s brow creased. Those times were well beyond him, now.\n“Do you know what your name means, my son?”\n“No, your Holiness, I do not.”\n“It is a statement or belief; a creed. Remember to walk uprightly in this world, my dearest Credo.”\nThe soft sound of Sanctus’ voice ebbed away into the back of Credo’s mind as his memory faded away. Credo reached for the snifter without hesitation to pour himself a glass. It had been years since he’d remembered that conversation. It was one of the turning points to his career as an acolyte to the order, and a pivotal moment into adulthood. He had no idea he would become a target of Sanctus, nor become his right hand.\nThe things he’d done to get there haunted him—foolish, stupid things.\n‘I did it for Kyrie, for our future.’ But, deep down that was never the real reason. The heat built up in his chest and stomach as he leaned back with his legs spread. I could use one more glass, Credo rationalized as he poured another. Just as he was about to take a sip, a soft rap at his door caused him to reach for his sword on impulse, but eased when he saw Nero’s white head poke through.\n\u0026lsquo;Damn. Just like Nero to interrupt my plans of self-pity.\u0026rsquo;\n“How’d you get in here?” Credo barked; Nero barely took into account how grumpy Credo was. Perhaps he was so used to Credo’s abrasive behavior, or was simply unaffected by it.\n“Kyrie gave me the key.” Nero’s brow rose in amusement at Credo’s almost confused glare.\n“You and my sister have been awfully close. Did you steal it off of her?” Credo sneered as he downed his glass. Nero leaned in the doorway, arms crossed.\n“I just pointed out that she gave—me—the—key.” Nero reiterated, rolling his eyes. “You’re drinking this late, again huh?”\n“Go away, Nero.” Credo grunted, not amused by Nero’s game of twenty-one questions. But the boy strode into the room regardless as an open act of invading his privacy.\n\u0026lsquo;Nero, be damned.\u0026rsquo;\nNot anyone could be in this room. Kyrie wasn’t even allowed in here. What made Nero think he was more deserving? Credo sat back and reached for the glass grumpily.\n\u0026ldquo;He has no sense of self-control, Credo. You know what happens to those who’re unruly, don’t you?’\u0026rdquo; The soft titter of Sanctus’ laughter echoed at the back of his mind. The hair on Credo’s neck stood on end. Sanctus could not get a hold of Nero. Credo felt ill at ease at the idea. He was sure Nero knew nothing of those \u0026ldquo;initiations\u0026rdquo; the Order did in secrecy. Credo wanted to keep it that way. He would protect Nero for as long as he could. Not that he really needed it, now that he was a capable fighter for the Order. In fact, perhaps he was one of the best. His attitude on the other hand…\n“I spoke with his Holiness, today.” Credo let out tersely as Nero tumbled haphazardly into the divan. Credo watched him with furrowed brows as Nero’s muddied boots draped over one of the arms. Credo rubbed the bridge of his nose as he barreled on.\n“About?” Nero dug a finger in his ear. Credo seemed affronted by the act.\n“Your inability to cooperate with the Order, it seems.”\n“Look, it’s not my fault those assholes have a problem with how I do things. It gets the freaking job done. Case closed.” Nero made hand gestures as if to wipe his hands of something, tossing his hair out from his face. Credo’s eyes narrowed before downing another glass.\n“I get that you are doing all this to prove something. But, don’t be an idiot.” By the fifth cup, Credo could feel the velvety burn of the amber liquid coat his insides. He felt right where he needed to be, almost ready to ignore Nero’s presence.\n“Gonna give me a taste of that?”\nCredo had almost forgotten about Nero for a moment, swiveling slowly in his creaky wooden chair. Credo regarded Nero’s crouched sitting position on the couch. The boy was staring at him openly with that curious gaze of his.\nCredo curled his lip. Just what was he looking at, anyway? Credo’s eyes wandered lazily over Nero’s facial features. He’d grown so much in these last two years alone. Nero had always been quite the pipsqueak in his younger years, constantly following the older male about. He’d been so taken to Credo as a child. It was borderline ridiculous how much time they’d spent together. In some ways Credo was like the brotherly figure Nero enjoyed looking up to. The boy made no secret about it. Credo never wanted to admit it, but Nero looking up to him was an experience he did not like at first. The same snot-nosed brat he’d encountered on those orphanage steps was no longer a boy. Nero was fast becoming a man. Unable to hold their gaze, the older man averted his eyes elsewhere.\n“Aren\u0026rsquo;t you too young to be drinking this? Don\u0026rsquo;t ask again.” Credo chuffed.\n“I’m not a little kid anymore, Credo.”Credo pausing at Nero’s intense gaze. The older man looked away again, the awkward silence filling the space between them. It was true that he was no longer a child. Credo also understood the rift between them was due to them being generations apart. He just didn\u0026rsquo;t understand teenagers nowadays. He wondered if he had been this moody and insufferable at that age.\nCredo\u0026rsquo;s stomach coiled. His childhood had not been the best. Perhaps he had poor judgement in what kids were \u0026ldquo;up to\u0026rdquo; these days. Maybe he was just getting old.\n“I suppose you aren’t.” Credo finally said as he reached for another glass atop the shelf, pouring the glass to the brim. Nero’s ears perked. Credo pretended he didn’t see that as he poured the glass. Surely there was a law out there somewhere he was breaking.\nStory of my life, Credo thought sourly.\nThe soft shuffle of Nero’s leather-strapped boots behind Credo made his shoulders tense. Nero sat at the edge of the desk, plucking the glass from Credo’s hand, their fingers touching. Credo looked up slowly to watch Nero drink down the amber liquid, a trail of liquor dripping down his throat. Nero watched Credo reach for the snifter, stopping the older man from getting it. There was an almost teasing smile about that young face of his—Credo gave him a suspicious glance.\n“Why are you here, anyway?” Credo asked. He wasn’t sure why he didn’t ask sooner.\nNero instantly seemed withdrawn, cocking his head to the side to shrug nonchalantly. “I don’t know, to be honest. I hoped you’d be here, so I came up.”\nHe came for him? Credo shifted in his chair, slightly guarded by Nero’s confession. Working for the order had kept Credo pre-occupied most days. There was a time when they hardly saw one another, both of them pre-occupying themselves with the swarms of demons occupying the outskirts of Fortuna City. His cheeks colored a bit, clearing his throat. It had been quite some time since they even sat in the same room together. To do so now was more uncomfortable than anything. He hardly recognized the young man sitting just a hair’s breadth away from him.\n“I suppose I’m glad… you came.” Credo leaned back into the chair, placing his glass down.\n“You do?” Nero sounded genuinely surprised, his cheeks tinged pink. Was that hope he’d seen? Credo decided not to look at his face. It was nothing to be excited about, honestly. He didn’t know why Nero had to act so… he didn’t know how to describe it, really.\n“Well, I mean—“ Had that been uncertainty in the boy’s eyes? “Err… never mind.” Credo watched him do his trademark nose-scratch. He found himself a bit irritated.\nYes, it was definitely time for Nero to leave.\n“It’s time for you to go.”\n“Aw, c’mon Credo!” Nero’s head shot up, standing up to lean on the arm-rests to Credo’s chair, barring his way from escape. The older man let out a sound, curling his lip at Nero’s closeness. Credo gripped into the table. Something about this was wrong.\n“You’re making me uncomfortable by just being here, so if you don’t mind—” Credo let out, clasping his hand over his mouth as soon as it left him. He had way too much to drink, deciding upon blaming the copious amounts of brandy he’d devoured for its effects. Nero’s eyes lowered as he moved closer until they inhaled each other’s exhales. Nero’s pink, parted lips were in Credo’s vision.\nWait a fucking minute. What is happening here, exactly?\n“Credo, I—” Credo’s eyes widened, glued to his chair as Nero bit his lower lip. The sound of the door closing downstairs sent Credo rushing out of the chair. Nero gave a soft curse.\n“Kyrie’s here.” Credo whispered out.\n“Let her come, then?” Credo heard from behind him. The older man whipped around to stare at the boy, brows furrowed.\n“You\u0026rsquo;re the one who said she never comes up here!” Nero whispered harshly, his cheeks red. The boy’s cheeks lit up brighter than a Christmas tree at Credo’s reprimanding glare.\n“Yes, but—“ The hamster wheel in his mind was finally beginning to turn. This was probably the first time in a long time since he’d seen Nero embarrassed with himself. It still reminded him that Nero was still so very young. Way too young.\n\u0026lsquo;Too young for… stop it.\u0026rsquo;\nThe noises died away, both of them standing at the door as if they\u0026rsquo;d committed murder, uncertain as to why they were both hiding like mice in an attic.\nWhat was Nero going to say back then had they not been interrupted? Later on the commander pondered on it but decided to let it go. Deep down, he didn’t want to know. It was just better if Nero did him a favor and kept his mouth shut. Another glass of brandy would help douse his brain free of whatever odd and guilty feeling he had about their little interaction.\nHe hoped, anyway.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/feed/sav/ch1/","summary":"Chapter One “You called to see me, your Holiness?”\nSanctus drew a pale, long-fingered hand towards Credo as he signaled him to sit down beside him. Agnus peered back at Credo with contempt, his ridiculous monocle glinting as he did so.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, Credo. I was just leaving.\u0026rdquo; Agnus decided to say a little too loudly. \u0026ldquo;Your excellency.\u0026rdquo; He bowed dramatically as he exited the room.\nDespite several attempts to take his place, Credo was almost certain Sanctus would never sway for the likes of Agnus.","title":"Sine Alise Volare (Without Wings)"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, the blog is live.
