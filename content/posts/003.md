### If you're reading this, the blog is live.

I've created this blog entirely from Hugo and the power of Node.js! Welcome to my blog. I will be using this
blog like a database for work I post rather it being lost to platforms over time *(which has happened)*. I will
be opening a shop soon that will have my work available to the public. Stay tuned!

### Things To Expect

In the coming months, I'll have both an official physical copy of Magnum Opus as well as a 
PDF downloadable version of the book in-shop. I've also designed funky stickers, and looking into charms
at some point. Stay tuned!

**Summary**

- New cover almost complete
- ETA is before Christmas
- Shop opens with merch to drop
