### Welcome to my 18+ blog site!

>A *giant* reminder that **NO minors under any circumstance are allowed anywhere on this site.** I'm not your parent, and anti-social behavior can be left at the door. Thank you! ðŸ’“

To my freaks of nature, **welcome!**

My website is back better than ever with the help of Hugo Syntax. I won't get into it too deeply, but I had to get away from bloated site platforms like Wordpress. I love the face-lift and best of all the site runs fast and quick! 

I decided it's time to make a professional website that showcases all my skill sets in one place where I could house all my portfolio work, as well as future projects, stories, and everything 
inbetween. 

I am moving away from fee-hungry platforms that censor me and taking back control.
I have a lot in store for people who are interested in supporting my art journey!
