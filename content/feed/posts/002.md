### Slowly Migrating!

I am still migrating a lot of files back and forth from the old version of DT and I am hoping to get it all situated soon. I practically learned a new computer language within a week's time, and I'm still figuring this syntax out, but MAN I am LOVING it! 

I am debating using DISQUS still, or using a stand-alone comments section, but I'm a lazy motherfucker. I did the hard work of setting this site up, I think I'll just keep Disqus. lol I will be using the site tagging system to keep track of art, which you can find up above in the 'Search' engine for my site, or check tags, which is a handy way to find what you're looking for quickly!
